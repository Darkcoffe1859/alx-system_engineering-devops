The open system interconnection model is a conceptual model from the international organisation for standardization. (ISO) that provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of system interconnection. in the OSI reference model, the communication between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers:
physical
Data link
Network
Transport
Session
Presentation
Application
The OSI model serves as a reference framework for network protocols and helps in understanding how different networking technologies and protocols internet however its important to note that oin practice real world networking protocols often combine multiple OSI layers into a single layer or have variations based on specific implementations
